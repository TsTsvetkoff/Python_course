If you use the Notepad program to code program files on Windows, be careful to pick the type All Files when it
comes time to save your file, and give the file a .py suffix explicitly. Otherwise,
Notepad will save your file with a .txt extension (e.g., as script1.py.txt), making it difficult to run in some launching schemes.
Worse, Windows hides file extensions by default, so unless you have changed your view options you may not even notice that you’ve coded a text file and not a Python file. The file’s icon may give this away—if it doesn’t have a snake on it, you may
have trouble. Uncolored code in IDLE and files that open to edit instead of run
when clicked are other symptoms of this problem.
Microsoft Word similarly adds a .doc extension by default; much worse, it adds
formatting characters that are not legal Python syntax. As a rule of thumb, always
pick All Files when saving under Windows, or use a more programmer-friendly
text editor such as IDLE. IDLE does not even add a .py suffix automatically—a
feature programmers tend to like, but users do not.
